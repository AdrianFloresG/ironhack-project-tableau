# Ironhack | Project - Tableau

## Objective

Create a story in Tableau consisting of multiple dashboards that reflect key information from databases from different sources.


## Overview

In this project we will work on creating a dashboard in Tableau to reflect key indicators on the state of deforestation globally. In addition, we will analyze if there is a relationship between the percentage of forest area in the country, the CO2 emitted per person and the GDP of the country itself.


## Results

Input

We have introduced the following key databases:

-	Forest area by country
-	Annual CO2 emissions by country
-	Population by country
-	Countries by continent
-	Economic information by country

Output

The following information has been reflected:

-	Forest Area Share by continent 2020
-	Forest Area Evolution by year
-	Forest Area Evolution by continent
-	Map of the Forest Area by country
-	Evolution of the Forest Area by country between 1992-2020
-	Relationship between the Forest Area, CO2 per person and the GDP of the country
